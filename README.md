# What I learned?
From this application, I had the chance to applying Software Engineering concepts learned from the module such as design patterns, object-orientated modelling, encapsulation and abstraction. It helped me apply software engineering life cycles and enabled me to work in a team where work is evenly split and used everybody's strengths
